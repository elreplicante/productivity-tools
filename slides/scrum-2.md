## Constant self-reflection

<p class="fragment">frequent reflection</p>
<p class="fragment">few moments of honesty each morning to define the work in front of you</p>
<p class="fragment">brainstorm a few minutes to see if you can solve the issue</p>
<p class="fragment">if not, put it in your to-do list for later action</p>
<p class="fragment">more often than not, the problem lies more in ourselves than in our situation</p>
