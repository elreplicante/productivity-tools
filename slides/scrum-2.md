##Constant self-reflection

<p class="fragment">Frequent reflection</p>
<p class="fragment">Few moments of honesty each morning to define the tasks</p>
<p class="fragment">Brainstorm a few minutes to see if you can solve the issue</p>
<p class="fragment">If not, put it in your to-do list for later action</p>
<p class="fragment">More often than not, the problem lies more in ourselves than in our situation</p>
